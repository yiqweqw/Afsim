Documentation Linking
=====================

This document is a component of the :doc:`afsim_documentation_standard`.

Terms:

* **Target**: Targets may be linked to, and may be internally or externally defined.
* **Link**: Links are reference to targets, rendered as clickable hyperlinks.
* **Label**: Labels define internal targets. The target is the next element after the label.
* **Cross-Reference**: Cross-references are links to internal targets.
* **Internal**: Refers to targets defined within the documentation.
* **External**: Refers to other resources, usually websites, defined outside of the documentation.

External Linking
----------------

External linking markup is provided by ReStructuredText, which refers to external link targets as Hyperlink Targets. These may be linked to by Hyperlink References.

Internal Linking
----------------

Internal linking, or cross-referencing, is a core feature of the AFSIM Documentation. Through internal linking, the documentation is more navigable, and therefore more valuable to the user.

Internal linking markup is available in multiple forms through a number of sources.

.. _DOCUMENTATION_LINKING INTRA-DOCUMENT CROSS-REFERENCING:

Intra-Document Cross-Referencing
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Also known as short-hand cross-referencing, this is the simplest form of cross-referencing. Provided by reStructuredText and docutils, this markup renders a link to a target in the same file.

Within a given document, a section may be referenced without the need for an explicit label. Implicit labels matching the section name are generated automatically by docutils.

Inter-Document Cross-Referencing
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Sphinx offers improved cross-referencing capability through the use of roles.

doc
'''

The **:doc:** role is available to reference a specific document within the documentation build.

The argument passed to this role must be a valid document name, omitting the file extension. The name must be prepended with a relative path from the referencing
document, or the absolute path from the documentation root (*/docs/...*).

.. list-table::
   :class: example-rst
   :header-rows: 1

     -   Referencing a Document

         This document is a component of

         the :doc:`afsim_documentation_standard`.

.. note:: For this example, the referenced document is located in the same directory as the referencing document. A prepended path is required only when the referenced document is in a different directory.

.. tip:: To ascend the directory tree, ``../`` may be provided as part of the relative path. Alternatively, paths beginning at the documentation root (*/docs/...*) are always valid.

ref
'''

Also included with Sphinx Markup, the **:ref:** role, may be used to reference any explicit target, regardless of the target's location.

.. _DOCUMENTATION_LINKING REFERENCING SECTIONS:

Referencing Sections
''''''''''''''''''''

.. important:: The following markup is replaced by `Automatic Section Labels`_. It is documented here because it appears frequently throughout the AFSIM documentation.

To reference a section *outside* of the current document, an explicit link target / unique label must be placed immediately before the section name.

To ensure that a given label is globally unique, a robust naming convention should be preferred, including both the section name, and the name of the parent document.

To support an example, a label has been implemented for this section:

.. code-block:: rest

   .. _DOCUMENTATION_LINKING REFERENCING SECTIONS:

   Referencing Sections
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   ...

With the label provided above, a cross-reference to this section from another document is now possible.

.. note:: For this example, the reference is made from within the same document. Identical markup is used to reference this section from other documents.

   :class: example-rst
   :header-rows: 1

   `Automatic Section Labels`_


Automatic Section Labels
''''''''''''''''''''''''

Often, it is desirable to reference a section of a different document. While this is supported through the previous markup, it requires that an explicit
link target be written for any such section. Because this is common and requires globally unique labels, it results in maintenance challenges.

The AFSIM Sphinx Extension, "afsim-autosectionlabel" was created to overcome this issue. This extension uses the **:ref:** role with AFSIM Markup to link to sections
outside of the current document, without requiring the developer to create an explicit link target above the section title. This usage of **ref** requires that the argument is
a valid file path and name, starting at the documentation root (*docs/...*), with a single ``:`` between the file name (extension omitted) and section name. Aliases/Captions are
supported but not required.

.. list-table::
   :class: example-rst
   :header-rows: 1

         See :ref:`Platform Overview<docs/platform:Overview>`

Additionally, afsim-autosectionlabel supports references to duplicate sections for instances where a given section recurs in a single document. Any reference to
the first occurrence of a given section follows the markup described above, while duplicate sections are referenceable through insertion of a ``:`` and the parent section name.

.. note:: This capability is provided for full support of certain legacy documentation. Identically named sections in a single document should be avoided.

.. note:: Automatic Section Labeling is not supported prior to AFSIM 2.8.0.

AFSIM Object Cross-Referencing
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

AFSIM Object Links (links the documentation of AFSIM defined objects) are fundamental to the utility of the AFSIM Documentation. Markup and examples are provided in each
object's respective :ref:`categorical standard<docs/developer/afsim_documentation_standard:Categorical Standards>`\. Linking markup varies by object, but
is generally similar to the markup described above. Newly introduced object types should support cross-referencing and adhere to the general markup described below.

Intra-Document
''''''''''''''

Within a given page, shorthand-markup may be used to cross-reference an object

.. list-table::
   :class: example-rst
   :header-rows: 1

   * - **Template Markup**
     - **Template Result**

   * - .. code-block:: rest

         .. <object-type>:: <object-name> [<object-args>]

         ...

         See `<object-name>`_

     - .. parsed-literal::

         **<object-name> [<object-args>]**

         ...

         See <object-name>

Inter-Document
''''''''''''''

Cross-referencing objects defined in a separate document requires the use of AFSIM Markup, more specifically, custom Sphinx roles.
Each object type defines a unique role which may be used to cross-reference a defined object of that type.

.. list-table::
   :class: example-rst
   :header-rows: 1

   * - **Template Object Document**
     - **Template Reference Markup**

   * - .. code-block:: rest

         .. <file-name>.rst

         ...

         .. <object-type>:: <object-name> [<object-args>]

     - .. code-block:: rest

         Reference to object defined in <file-name>.rst

         ...

         :<object-type>:`<object-name>`
