AFSIM Documentation Standard
============================

This standard is a component of the :doc:`documentation_guide`. It defines rules and guidelines to which AFSIM documentation should adhere.

This standard details **markup**, code instructions that may be used throughout the AFSIM Documentation's
reStructuredText files to render **constructs** in the generated output.
For the purposes of AFSIM Documentation, constructs are the result of processed markup.

Markup is available through the following sources, and processed by those sources' respective generators:

.. _Markup Table:

.. table::
   :class: example-rst

   =======================  ============  ============
   Type                     Generator     Dependencies
   =======================  ============  ============
   ReStructuredText Markup  docutils      python
   Sphinx Markup            sphinx-build  docutils
   AFSIM Markup             various       sphinx-build
   =======================  ============  ============

AFSIM capability is vast, thus the associated documentation is also vast. A `Common Standard`_ is defined which generally governs all AFSIM documentation. However, due
to the variety of capability across AFSIM, :ref:`more specific rules and guidelines<docs/developer/afsim_documentation_standard:Categorical Standards>` are defined
categorically, to provide specific guidance based on the nature of the documentation being created.

Common Standard
---------------

Sphinx recognizes the full restructuredText (RST) base markup as defined in docutils_, the reStructuredText authoritative document.

Sphinx also includes `enhanced markup constructs`_ by default. For enhanced markup, Sphinx publishes and updates the authoritative document.

These enhancements are further expanded by :doc:`afsim_sphinx_extensions`.
For the additional markup provided by these extensions, this standard is the authoritative document.

.. _docutils: https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html
.. _`enhanced markup constructs`: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/1.8/usage/restructuredtext/index.html

ReStructuredText and Sphinx offer wide syntactic flexibility for most markup, such that the end user of these
tools is afforded the freedom to choose the syntax best suited to their purpose, organization, and/or project.

This standard defines a preferred subset of the available markup syntax, provided by the aforementioned tools,
and the expanded markup available through custom Sphinx extensions.

To maintain flexibility and ensure that this standard does not invalidate the syntax used for markup in existing documentation, the following rules apply:

1. For all existing AFSIM Documentation, the syntax used for a newly added markup element should follow the existing syntax within a given document, if available.
2. If a new markup element is to be introduced to an existing document, or new documentation is being authored, the author should first refer to this standard.

.. tip:: On the sidebar, click This Page > Show Source to view the RST used to generate the current page.

Not all ReStructuredText and/or Sphinx markup elements are mentioned in this standard. Elements not covered by this
standard may also be used, and their usage should follow the recommendation provided by the most recent authoritative document.

Sections
""""""""

.. topic:: Titles

   Page and section titles are created when a line of text is followed by a line of specific characters.
   Sphinx dynamically determines what character represents a given section level on a per-page basis.

   Therefore, deeper sections (sub-sections) are created when a new symbol is used for a title in a given document.

   ReStructuredText allows many unique characters to be used for this purpose (multiple syntax), however for AFSIM Documentation,
   Page Titles, Section Titles, and Sub-Section Titles will adhere to the convention provided in the example below.

        - .. Pseudo-Classes are reserved for use
             in the AFSIM Documentation Standard.

          :pseudo-h5:`Sub-3-Section Title`
          :pseudo-h6:`Sub-4-Section Title`

   A page title should appear at the beginning of each `.rst` document. In general, each document should feature a single page title.
   Sections, and first level sub-sections feature a page-spanning underline, and are collapsible. Deliberate selection of section depth for a given
   subject is important to ensure separations in a document are logical and consistent.

   .. note:: Sub-sections beyond a depth of four are not supported. `Lists`_, `Topics`_, or `Transitions`_ may serve as suitable alternatives to greater section depth.

   Any number of Sections, and/or sub-sections may appear in a single document, as long as the content of the sections relate to the page title. However,
   it is recommended that for a given document, sections are uniquely named.

   .. note:: This applies for sections included through the **.. include::** directive. See `Include`_ for more information.

Table of Contents
"""""""""""""""""

A local table of contents may be created via the **.. contents::** directive. A table of contents is shown at the |top of this page|.

.. |top of this page| replace:: :doc:`top of this page<afsim_documentation_standard>`

.. topic:: Options

   .. list-table::

        - "entry"

Topics
""""""

A topic contains a body of closely related elements. Topics are normally brief and self contained. A topic may be an effective alternative to further sub-sections, and may be used to
clearly separate a short block of documentation from the surrounding page. Unlike sections, it is acceptable for multiple topics to share the same name in a given document. However,
multiple topics sharing the same name should not appear within the same section. Topics are not allowed within other body elements.

.. tip:: To generate a topic without a title, simply provide the escape character ``\`` in place of a title.

       Dedented content will end the topic.

Transitions
"""""""""""

.. role:: example-transition
   :class: example-transition

Transitions may be used between paragraphs to mark divisions in text, signaling a subject change or similar separation that is less significant than
the separation created by topics_ or sections_\ .

Links
"""""

Links (or hyperlinks) are used to connect a documentation element to another location (a target). Targets may be in other documents, the same document, or external.

Linking and cross-referencing are discussed in :doc:`documentation_linking`\ .

Comments
""""""""

Comments are messages that appear only with the reStructuredText. They serve to provide additional detail to documentation authors,
without creating unnecessary noise in generated output. Comments are created when a ``..`` is given at the beginning of a line, preceded by a blank line,
and followed only by text. Comments may span multiple lines, but subsequent lines must match the indentation of the first line.

   .. list-table::
      :class: example-rst

               the generated output.

            After comment.

Inline Markup
"""""""""""""

Inline markup is used to modify the format of specific words or symbols (elements). Only one markup may be applied to a given element at a time. (i.e. Nested markup is not allowed.)

.. topic:: Text Decorations

   .. list-table::
      :class: example-rst
      :header-rows: 1

      * - **Markup**

        -   *Italic Text*

            **Bold Text**

            ``Monotype Text``

   Inline Markup should be used as follows:

   * Bold

     * Placing strong emphasis on a particular word in a sentence
     * When first defining a term that is not linked
   * Italics

     * Directory hierarchies and file names
   * Monotype

     * Small code references where a literal block is not appropriate
     * References to markup elements such as directives and roles
     * Inline references to a specific ASCII or Unicode character

   .. note:: The list provided is not all inclusive, but seeks to offer examples of common usage. Any element may use inline markup as is necessary.

   Explicit roles for inline markup exist, and should not be used for the markup mentioned above.

.. topic:: Scripts

   Superscripts and subscripts are also inline markup elements; however, they are invoked with explicit roles.

   .. tip:: Roles must be preceded and followed by white space. To render scripts without gaps, an escaped white space character (\\ followed by space) is needed.

   .. list-table::
      :class: example-rst
      :header-rows: 1

            H\ :sub:`2`\ O

Lists
"""""

.. topic:: Bulleted Lists

   When the order of items in a list is not important, the list should be bulleted using ``*``. A blank line must precede a list.

            * Point A
            * Point B

.. topic:: Enumerated Lists

   For enumerated lists, prefer arabic numbers (i.e. 1., 2., etc.). If necessary, ``#.`` may also be used. Prefer explicit enumerations starting with ``1.``.

            #. Point 2

.. topic:: Sub-Lists

   Sub-Lists should follow the rules provided for other `Lists`_. A sub-list must be indented to match the indentation of the first non-whitespace character, after the
   list markup in the parent list. A blank line must precede a sub-list.

Admonitions
"""""""""""

Admonitions denote important information to the user and/or developer.

For each construct, the following rules apply:

1. Indentation must be uniform for every line of content, minimum one level of indentation.
2. Content should begin on the same line as the invocation, and must be followed by at least one empty line (prefer one empty line).

Literal Blocks
""""""""""""""

With the exception of parsed literal blocks, the content of a literal block is not parsed/interpreted by Sphinx during the documentation build. Given that fact,
literal blocks offer the developer an effective means to present syntactically significant content to the user, or another developer.

.. topic:: Basic Literal Blocks

   Literal blocks may be invoked in a number of forms:

   * Expanded Form: Used when there is no logically-continuous content preceding the block.
   * Fully Minimized Form: Commonly used when the content of the preceding paragraph is logically continued by the literal block.

     * .. note:: The ``::`` at the end of the invocation line will appear as a single ``:`` in the output.
   * Partially Minimized Form: Uncommonly used, but preferred when use of a ``:`` to punctuate the preceding content is not desirable/appropriate.

   For all forms, the following rules apply:

   1. Indentation must be uniform for every line of the literal content, minimum one level of indentation.
   2. Block content must be preceded and followed by at least one empty line (prefer one empty line).

.. topic:: Parsed Literal Blocks

   Parsed literal blocks are used when the literal block construct is desired while preserving use of linking/cross-referencing, and other markup.

   A Parsed Literal Block should not be used when a Literal Block is sufficient.

Line Block
""""""""""

Where explicit or non-standard line breaks and/or indentation are necessary, it is acceptable to use a Line Block.

This feature may be used to overcome the default behavior of generated text output, where a single newline is ignored, and multiple whitespace characters are condensed.

Include
"""""""

The **.. include::** directive is used to include a separate file, inline, into the current file.

Include should be used sparingly. A stated purpose of ReStructuredText is that files using the standard are as readable in their unprocessed
form (.rst) as they are when generated to other formats. Unnecessary or excessive use of the include directive results in documentation
that is logically fragmented, making it more difficult to read and/or revise.

Files included using this directive should have the (.txt) extension, and care should be taken to ensure that sections contained within the included text
file adhere to the convention established within the including file. See `Sections`_ for more information.

The **.. figure::** directive is functionally similar to image, except that the included image may be followed by a caption, and/or a legend.

The following rules apply:

1. Directive must be preceded by an empty line.
2. Options must be consistently indented.
3. Figure caption must be preceded and succeeded by an empty line, and be a simple paragraph (Caption may be omitted by using ``..`` in place of the caption).
4. If used, the figure legend must be preceded and succeeded by an empty line, and occur after the figure caption.

Categorical Standards
---------------------

The following categorical standards extend the `AFSIM Documentation Standard`_:

* :doc:`Command Documentation<standard_documentation_command>`
* :doc:`Model Documentation<standard_documentation_model>`
* :doc:`Script Class Documentation<standard_documentation_class>`

Documentation in each category adheres to the rules defined in the associated standard, as well as the rules defined within the `Common Standard`_.

When rules in a given categorical standard conflict with rules defined in the common standard, related documentation will adhere to the rules defined in the relevant categorical standard.
