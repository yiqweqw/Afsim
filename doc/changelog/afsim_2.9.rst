Development Updates
===================

* The ``myst-parser`` Python package is a new requirement for generating documentation.
  The Python package requirements have been combined into a top-level ``requirements.txt`` file for convenient and consistent installation.
  This file may be used with a command such as:

   ``pip install --user --requirement requirements.txt``
* Updated the following third party libraries to address security vulnerabilities and access new features: SDL from 2.0.14 to 2.0.16, Curl from 7.71.1 to 7.79.1, Libtiff from 4.1.0 to 4.3.0, JPEG from 9b to 9d, FFMPEG from 4.2.1 to 4.2.4, GDAL from 3.0.4 to 3.3.2, Qt from 5.12.9 to 5.12.11, and Proj from 7.0.0 to 8.1.1. See `Security Updates`_ for more information. (:issue:`AFSIM-1817`)
* Changed default value for ``PROMOTE_HARDWARE_EXCEPTIONS`` CMake flag to true. Plugins must be compiled with the same value as the host application was compiled with. (:issue:`AFSIM-1640`, :issue:`AFSIM-1616`)
* Modified CMake configuration, for versions 3.13 and higher, so that Visual Studio user files will not be automatically overwritten. The macro ``write_vcproj_user`` was renamed to ``create_vs_debug_env``. (:issue:`AFSIM-2387`)
* Add new type-safe coordinate vector classes for each of the major coordinate frames. These new classes are available in the ``ut::coords`` namespace. They currently have a deprecated implicit conversion to ``UtVec3<T>``, the legacy non-coordinate-specific vector class. This will be removed in a future release, leaving only an explicit conversion. (:issue:`AFSIM-1177`)
* Added convenience macros for C++14, C++17, and C++20 compiler attributes to ``UtCompilerAttributes.hpp``.
* Added ``ut::stacktrace`` as a stand-in for C++23's ``std::stacktrace``. (:issue:`AFSIM-1732`)
* The remaining \*.hxx and \*.cxx files in util were renamed to \*.hpp and \*.cpp for consistency with coding standards.
  The old \*.hxx headers are deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
  In the meantime compatibility stubs are provided which emit a message (Visual Studio) or warning (GCC). (:issue:`AFSIM-2395`)
* Newer versions of Sphinx, including 3.x and 4.x, are now supported for building documentation. Sphinx 2.1 remains the minimum supported version. (:issue:`AFSIM-1343`)
