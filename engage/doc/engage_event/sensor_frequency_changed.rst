.. _ENGAGE_EVENT_SENSOR_FREQUENCY_CHANGED:

SENSOR_FREQUENCY_CHANGED
------------------------

Format
======

::

   <time> <event> <platform> Sensor: <sensor name> Mode: <mode name> \\
     LLA: <lat> <lon> <alt> m \\
     Beam: <beam number> Frequency Id: <id> Frequency: <frequency> [\\]
     ...

.. note:: There may be one or more frequency detail entries for this event, one for
          each beam defined for the sensor mode.  This event may occur when a mode
          is not selected and does not necessarily represent an active transmitter
          frequency change.

Breakdown
=========

<time>
    current simulation time
<event>
    simulation event that occurred
<platform>
    name of communications platform
Sensor: <sensor name>
    name of the sensor
Mode: <mode name>
    sensor mode (modes are defined in user input file)
LLA: <lat> <lon> <alt> m
    The platform location; altitude is always in meters
Beam: <beam number>
    The sensor mode beam number for this frequency detail entry
Frequency Id: <id>
    The beam transmitter frequency Id setting from the configured alternate frequency list
Frequency: <frequency>
    The beam transmitter frequency setting that corresponds to the frequency Id

How it Appears in Output
========================

::
