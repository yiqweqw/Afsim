//! A support class for electromagnetic interactions.
//!
//! This class is used to provide a common mechanism for performing electro-
//! magnetic interactions (i.e.: interactions involving electromagnetic
//! radiation). These interactions can be communications, sensing, interference
//! or direct energy.
//!
//! Most of the class data is public and represents the results of various
//! calculations performed by the class. Much data is maintained so interested
//! parties can gather data about an interaction without having to modify
//! the underlying code.
//!
//! Not all data members are applicable to all types of interactions. Because
//! this class is used as the base class for things like WsfComm::Result and
//! WsfSensorResult, it must be necessarily complex to support the just
//! about any type of electromagnetic interaction.
