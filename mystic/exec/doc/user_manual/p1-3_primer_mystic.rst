Mystic
======

**Mystic** is a primary WSF application used to visually observe simulation results and statistics.

Simulation results are recorded when an **event_pipe** command block is provided within the scenario.  
The event_pipe blocks create AFSIM Event Recording(*.aer*) files, which are read and displayed in a geographic context using Mystic.

Quick Start
-----------

Mystic is directly accessible from the command line.  It may also be started from the Mystic desktop shortcut, included with default AFSIM installation, 
or by double clicking an *.aer* file from the Wizard **Project Browser** menu, after a scenario has been simulated in Mission or Warlock.

Launch Mystic
"""""""""""""

Mystic (mystic.exe) may be launched via the desktop shortcut, or from the command line.  If launched from the command line, an AFSIM Event Recording file may be provided as an argument.

   .. note ::

      If Mystic does not execute as expected, ensure that the AFSIM installation path is set in the system environment variables.  The Mystic executable (mystic.exe) is located in the '/bin' directory of the AFSIM release file structure.

The Mystic command line syntax is provided below:

.. code-block::

   >> mystic.exe <event_recording_file>.aer
   or
   >> mystic.exe
   
Complete the steps below to open the *parachute_example* demo recording in Mystic:

1. Using the command line, navigate to the *parachute_example.aer* file location and launch Mystic with the *parachute_example.aer* file as an argument.

   * Alternatively, launch Mystic from the desktop shortcut and navigate to the scenario from the Mystic **Startup** window and open the *.aer* file for the scenario.

   Example:

   .. code-block::
   
      >> cd demos/parachute/output
      >> mystic.exe parachute_example.aer

2. The recording is paused when first loaded into Mystic. Click the Resume button (right arrow) from the Time Controller Toolbar to start the recording.

Launch Mystic From Wizard
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

Complete the steps below to launch the *parachute_example* simulation event recording file from Wizard:

1. Launch the *parachute_example* demo from Wizard.

2. Double click the generated *.aer* file found in the Wizard Project Browser to launch Mystic the recording in Mystic.

   .. note:: If no *.aer* file is visible in the Project Browser, first run the demo using either Warlock or Mission. The recording will be generated during the simulation.

3. Click the Resume button (right arrow) from the Time Controller Toolbar to start the recording.

Closer Look
-----------

The **Menu Toolbar** in Mystic provides the following controls for viewing results:  Play/Pause/Resume, Reverse, Restart, Set Clock Rate, Jump to Time, Time Slider, and Capture View.

Mystic's **Map Display** provides the user the ability to alter the geographic view to enhance visualization during playback. The **Map Display** may be be adjusted using the following mouse controls:

* 'Left-Click + Drag' - Translates the map with the mouse cursor.
* 'Double-Left-Click' - Zooms the map, centered on the mouse cursor.
* 'Mouse-Wheel' - Zooms the map in and out, centered on the mouse cursor.
* 'Middle-Click + Drag' - Rotates and tilts the view.

.. tip:: Familiarity with the Map Display and mouse controls is necessary for the completion of subsequent modules.

Similar to Wizard and Warlock, Mystic provides "dialogue" windows that provide platform specific data and information.  The dialogue windows are accessed through the View menu.

* The **Platform Browser** window lists each platform in the scenario.

* The **Platform Options** window lists the map display options for a platform or a group of platforms, allowing the user to visualize important platform interactions and hide everything else.  High level Platform Options consist of: Platform Labels, Range Rings, Vectors, Interaction Lines, History, and Movement.

* The **Platform Details** window displays state information/data for the selected platform.

A **Platform Context** Menu is available for each platform, allowing the user to interact with the selected platform in various ways.  Right-click on a platform in the Map Display to open its Platform Context Menu.
