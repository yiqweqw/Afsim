Additionally, from the Platform Details right-click menu, the user may plot data for all platforms in one of the selected platform's groups (type, side, category). This will automatically apply a filter to the plot. The user may also manually add a filter in the plot dialog, located above the list of platforms.

Data Rings
==========

|PLATFORM_DETAILS_DATA_RING_IMAGE|

Right clicking on a numerical value also provides an option to create or remove a data ring for the selected platform. When adding a ring, the user will be presented with a dialog in which they can specifiy a desired minimum and maximum value for the ring. A platform can have any number of data rings, but only one ring per data item.


Data Displays
=============

.. image:: ../images/wkf_data_displays_prefs.png

Most items in the platform details dialog may be dragged onto the map or tether views to create a data overlay.  The overlays may be dragged around or closed using the close button which appears after hovering over the overlay.

.. note:: The preferences above will populate when the user edits the font size or color of the overlay.
