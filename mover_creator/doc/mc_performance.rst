Performance
+++++++++++

The performance page lists all the performance tests available for the vehicle the user created. 
Each test corresponds to a script found in *resources\\data\\mover_creator\\AFSIM_Scripts\\<vehicle-name>\\tests\\*. 
One or more subdirectories corresponding to the generated mover type(s) will exist inside of this directory.
In addition to executing the tests within the performance page, the user may run these tests directly using :doc:`Mission<mission>` or :doc:`warlock`, if desired.

Once the user moves to this page from the :doc:`Aerodynamics<mc_aerodynamics>` page, Mover Creator will generate the autopilot support tables if a P6DOF mover is being generated. These tables are placed in *\\resources\\data\\mover_creator\\AFSIM_Scripts\\<vehicle-name>\\p6dof_types\\<vehicle-type>\\<vehicle-name>\\controls\\autopilot_support_tables.txt*.
While this is occurring, a dialog with a progress bar will appear as shown below.

.. image:: images/performance_autopilot_support_dialog.png

.. note:: If a P6DOF/SixDOF mover is being generated, the vehicle must be controllable in order to navigate to this page from the :doc:`Aerodynamics<mc_aerodynamics>` page, unless a cNO_CONTROL configuration specified. If the vehicle is uncontrollable, an error message will appear as shown below.

.. image:: images/vehicle_uncontrollable.png

There are four parts to the performance page:

* Performance Tests - The list of tests available for the vehicle.  This list appears on the upper left side of the page.
* Series Selection - A series of checkboxes that allows the user to control which series are displayed in the Plotting Area. This appears directly below the Performance Test list.
* Test Details - The detailed description about the currently selected test from the Performance Test list.  The description text is located at the lower left side of the page.
* Plotting Area - The area where the data is plotted after the selected performance test has been executed.  The plotting area appears on the right side of the page.

Performance Tests
=================

The upper left area contains the list of available tests for the vehicle. This list updates based on the selection in the mover drop-down menu, located above the performance test list. In addition to the available movers, this menu contains a "Comparison" option to allow the user to compare the test results of different movers.
Different performance tests are available for different vehicle types and mover types (see the table below).

Series Selection
================

The series selection area allows the user to control which series are displayed in the Plotting Area. Buttons are also available to show/hide all series.
If "Comparison" is selected in the mover drop-down menu, the series checkboxes apply to both movers; i.e. checking/unchecking a series checkbox will show/hide the series for all movers.

.. image:: images/series_selection.png

Test Details
============

Selecting a test from the performance test list will populate the test details with the information relevant to the selected test. 
The test details area contains basic information about the test. This includes a description and a timestamp that indicates when the test was last executed. 
If the test has not been executed before, "Data Not Available" will be displayed instead of the date and time. 
For "Comparison" tests, timestamps for all generated movers are shown.

.. image:: images/test_details.png

Plotting Area
=============

.. image:: images/plotting_area.png

In order to get data to populate in the plotting area, the user first needs to select the test he or she wishes to perform.
If the test has been run previously, the plotting area will be populated with data from the last time the test was executed. 
The timestamp in the Test Details indicates when the test was last executed. 
If the vehicle geometry or aerodynamics was changed after the test was executed, the data is likely stale and the test should be rerun. 

To run a performance test, the user needs to click the *Execute* button located on the bottom left side of the page (just below the *Test Details* section).  When the user presses *Execute* an AFSIM process will spawn and perform the selected test.
When executing a "Comparison" test, the test will be run for all movers.

A *Calculating Performance* progress dialog will appear alerting the user to the fact that the test is being performed.  Test run times vary in length, but once complete the *Calculating Performance* progress dialog will disappear and the performance data will be populated in the plotting area.

.. image:: images/performance_dialog.png

Users can run as many performance tests on this page as they would like.  Should the user wish to look back at data in a previously run test he or she will not have to re-execute that test once they've already done so.


Navigation From the Performance Page
