Mover Creator
=============

Overview
--------

Mover Creator is an AFSIM software tool that provides a convenient, easy to use, GUI-based application that helps users create AFSIM input files for air-domain movers. Using a custom-defined, graphics-based vehicle definition, users are able to model aircraft, weapons, and engines for use in AFSIM. The Mover Creator interface allows users to create a new, custom model from an existing template model (provided by Mover Creator) or users can edit a model they previous created. Mover Creator includes several modules within the tool, which assist with a variety of functions, including:

* Modifying the vehicle geometry/configuration
* Adjusting the control configurations
* Tuning/modifying autopilot parameters
* Adjusting the aerodynamics
* Analyzing the performance of the vehicle
* Comparing the performance of different mover types
* Flight testing the vehicle within the AFSIM environment

Mover types currently supported in Mover Creator are :model:`WSF_RIGID_BODY_SIX_DOF_MOVER`, :model:`WSF_P6DOF_MOVER` and :model:`WSF_GUIDED_MOVER`. These models may be generated either individually or concurrently. 

Additionally, users of :model:`WSF_BRAWLER_MOVER` interested in investigating :model:`WSF_RIGID_BODY_SIX_DOF_MOVER` functionality may find the Brawler conversion tool useful.
