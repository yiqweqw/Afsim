//! An abstract interface for acquiring dynamic sensor/target data.
//!
//! This defines the interfaces by which SOSM communicates with the calling simulation.
//! In particular, it defines:
//!
//! - The methods used by the sensor, target and atmosphere objects to access the states of
//! sensor and target objects maintained within the calling simulation (position, orientation,
//! speed, etc.) that are needed to perform the detection calculations.
//!
//! - Data members that are passed back to the calling simulation which contain the values of
//! intermediate calculations that may be of interest to the calling simulation.
//!
//! This interface is abstract to allow the calling simulation to utilize any existing data that
//! it may be maintaining, thus potentially eliminating the need for recalculating the data that
//! is exposed by this class. Methods that are declared abstract represent the minimal set that
//! MUST be provided. All others are optional.
//!
//! The class SOSM_SimpleInteraction provides a minimal implementation for those simulations
//! who wish SOSM to compute the data.
