      /** UUID is the base class of all UUID classes that are used to specify a unique ID.
        *
        * A UUID is an 128-bit identifier that can be used to uniquely identify anything. From the UUIDspecification (IETF
        * rsf4122.txt):
        *
        *    One of the main reasons for using UUIDs is that no centralized authority is required to administer them (although
        *    one format usesvIEEE 802 node identifiers, others do not). As a result, generationvon demand can be completely
        *    automated, and used for a variety of purposes. The UUID generation algorithm described here supports very high
        *    allocation rates of up to 10 million per second per machine ifvnecessary, so that they could even be used as
        *    transaction IDs.
        *
        *    UUIDs are of a fixed size (128 bits) which is reasonably small compared to other alternatives. This lends itself
        *    well to sorting,vordering, and hashing of all sorts, storing in databases, simple allocation, and ease of
        *    programming in general.
        *
        *    Since UUIDs are unique and persistent, they make excellent Uniform Resource Names. The unique ability to generate
        *    a new UUID without a registration process allows for UUIDs to be one of the URNs with the lowest minting cost.
        *
        * The UUID specification supports a number of different versions of the UUID. The two supported by this class include
        * the "random number" version and the "time-based" version.
        *
        * For the "time-based" UUID, the format of the stringified version of the uuid is as follows:
        *
        *
        *    UUID                   = time-low "-" time-mid "-" time-high-and-version "-" clock-seq-and-reserved clock-seq-low "-" node
        *    time-low               = 4hexOctet
        *    time-mid               = 2hexOctet
        *    time-high-and-version  = 2hexOctet
        *    clock-seq-and-reserved = hexOctet
        *    clock-seq-low          = hexOctet
        *    node                   = 6hexOctet
        *    hexOctet               = hexDigit hexDigit
        *    hexDigit               = "0" / "1" / "2" / "3" / "4" / "5" / "6" / "7" / "8" / "9"
        *                             "a" / "b" / "c" / "d" / "e" / "f"
        *                             "A" / "B" / "C" / "D" / "E" / "F"
        *
        * Note that the UUID does not provide any publicly visible constructors. The reason for this is that UUIDs must be
        * constructed by the derived UUID classes since they are responsible for managing all aspects of the UUID's existence
        * which goes beyond what is declared here. Applications can use the CAL's generateUUID() method to generate new UUIDs
        * as required.
