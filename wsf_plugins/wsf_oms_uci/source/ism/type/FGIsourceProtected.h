        * concerning its usage. A single indicator that information qualifies as foreign government information for which the
        * source(s) of the information must be concealed. Within protected internal organizational spaces this element may be
        * used to maintain a record of the one or more indicators identifying information which qualifies as foreign government
        * information for which the source(s) of the information must be concealed. Measures must be taken prior to
        * dissemination of the information to conceal the source(s) of the foreign government information. An indication that
        * information qualifies as foreign government information according to CAPCO guidelines for which the source(s) of the
        * information must be concealed when the information is disseminated in shared spaces This data element has a dual
        * purpose. Within shared spaces, the data element serves only to indicate the presence of information which is
        * categorized as foreign government information according to CAPCO guidelines for which the source(s) of the
        * information is concealed, in which case, this data element's value will always be "FGI". The data element may also be
        * employed in this manner within protected internal organizational spaces. However, within protected internal
        * organizational spaces this data element may alternatively be used to maintain a formal record of the foreign country
        * or countries and/or registered international organization(s) that are the non-disclosable owner(s) and/or producer(s)
        * of information which is categorized as foreign government information according to CAPCO guidelines for which the
        * source(s) of the information must be concealed when the resource is disseminated to shared spaces. If the data
        * element is employed in this manner, then additional measures must be taken prior to dissemination of the resource to
        * shared spaces so that any indications of the non-disclosable owner(s) and/or producer(s) of information within the
        * resource are eliminated. In all cases, the corresponding portion marking or banner marking should be compliant with
        * CAPCO guidelines for FGI when the source must be concealed. In other words, even if the data element is being
        * employed within protected internal organizational spaces to maintain a formal record of the non-disclosable owner(s)
        * and/or producer(s) within an XML resource, if the resource is rendered for display within the protected internal
        * organizational spaces in any format by a stylesheet or as a result of any other transformation process, then the
        * non-disclosable owner(s) and/or producer(s) should not be included in the corresponding portion marking or banner
        * marking. PERMISSIBLE VALUES 1) The value "FGI" is permitted under the circumstances described above. 2) The full set
        * of values are defined in the Controlled Value Enumeration: CVEnumISMFGIProtected.xml ;
