Overview
========

COMPUTER is the UCI component that gives platforms the ability to send, receive, and process UCI messages via internal_links
and the Abstract Service Bus (ASB). Every platform with uci_component on it must have a computer and each uci_component must
have a connection to that computer in order to send messages.

In the example below, the platform EXAMPLE has an IRST and an ESM sensor that can send and receive UCI messages through their
corresponding uci_components. Each of their components have an internal_link to the computer which will send the messages it
receives to the ASB. The internal_link from the computer to the sensor uci_component in turn will send the messages it receives
from the ASB to be processed.

Example:
