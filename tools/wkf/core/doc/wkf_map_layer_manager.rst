Map Layer Manager
-----------------

The **map layer manager** is accessible from the View menu.  The browser may be docked in the left or right docking areas of the main window or be free-floating.

The plus button on the browser allows the addition of new map layers.  There are two major categories of map layers:

* |ZONE_ICON| Vector layers from ESRI shape files (.shp)
* |WORLD_ICON| Image layers from images files (.tif, .tiff, .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .bmp)

Once a layer is loaded, it will show in the managers list, with a check-box to toggle visibility, and a close button to remove the layer.

When loaded a image layer, three things may happen:

* |WORLD_ICON| The image may not contain geographic tags, in which case a dialog will ask for the latitude/longitude constraints of the image.
* |WORLD_ICON| The image may contain geographic tags (a geotiff), in which case the image will load in the proper location.
* |RADAR_ICON| The image may contain geographic tags and :command:`sensor_plot` tags, in which case the image will load in the proper location, and apply a color-gradient to the data's range.  Sensor plot images may also contain multiple layers of data.

Only one sensor plot image may be visible at a time.

Right clicking on a vector layer will give options to change the color of the displayed layer.

Right clicking on a image layer will give options to change the opacity of the displayed layer.

Right clicking on a :command:`sensor_plot` image layer will, in addition, give the option to change the data range of the color mapping or change the color gradient.
